# WebSocketSharp
A Service approach to web socket in .Net Core

This is an experimental experience. Use it at your own risk.

## Requirements
* Visual Studio (Code or any other)
* .Net Core ^3.1

### Controllers & Handlers
- explain the naming convention (Controller, Handler)
- explain on how to use each of the type and what is included.

#### WebSocketController vs MessageController
- explain the main roles of each.
- It's like glbal vs local.


## TODO
- [ ] Make it possible to switch between `string` and `binary`.
- [ ] Add the `ILogger` properly (hackish right now).
- [ ] Make appropriate uinit tests.
